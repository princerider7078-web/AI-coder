            <p>GrowPlants connects customers with verified, background-checked gardening service providers. Service providers are independent contractors, not employees of GrowPlants. We facilitate bookings but are not directly responsible for the service execution.</p>
            <p>Service providers are rated by customers after every booking. We reserve the right to remove providers who consistently receive ratings below 4 stars or violate our service quality guidelines.</p>
            <p>Service pricing varies by service type (fixed, hourly, or quote-based). The price confirmed at booking is binding. Additional charges may apply if the scope of work expands beyond what was booked — these will be discussed and agreed upon before execution.</p>

            <p>Cancellation policy: Full refund if cancelled 24+ hours before the scheduled time. Partial refund (50%) if cancelled within 24 hours. No refund if cancelled after the provider has arrived or the service has started.</p>
            <p>If a provider fails to show up (no-show), you will receive a full refund plus a 10% credit toward your next booking. If you are not available at the scheduled time (customer no-show), no refund will be issued.</p>
