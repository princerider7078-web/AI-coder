  // Gardening Services
  { id: "f11", category: "Gardening Services", question: "How are gardening service providers verified?", answer: "Every service provider on GrowPlants is personally interviewed and background-checked by our admin team. We verify government ID (Aadhar + PAN), experience references, and conduct trial assessments before approval. Providers are rated by customers after every booking — only 4-star-and-above providers stay on the platform." },
  { id: "f12", category: "Gardening Services", question: "Can I book a service for a specific date and time?", answer: "Absolutely! When booking a service, you select from available time slots: 9–11 AM, 11 AM–1 PM, 2–4 PM, or 4–6 PM. Bookings must be made at least 1 day in advance. The provider will confirm within 2 hours." },

  { id: "f14", category: "Gardening Services", question: "Do I need to provide tools for the gardener?", answer: "No, our gardeners come fully equipped with their own tools. For specialised services like balcony setup or landscape design, we also bring plants, soil, and materials as part of the service package." },

  // Account
  { id: "f15", category: "Account", question: "Do I need an account to order?", answer: "Yes, an account is required to place orders and book services. This helps us track your orders, manage deliveries, and provide personalised plant care support. Registration is free and takes less than a minute." },
  { id: "f16", category: "Account", question: "How do I reset my password?", answer: "Click on 'Login' then 'Forgot Password'. Enter your registered email or phone number, and we'll send you a secure reset link. The link is valid for 30 minutes." },
  { id: "f17", category: "Account", question: "Can I change my delivery address after placing an order?", answer: "You can change your delivery address only before the order is confirmed (status: Pending). Once confirmed, please contact us immediately via WhatsApp or phone — we'll do our best to update the address if the order hasn't been dispatched." },
